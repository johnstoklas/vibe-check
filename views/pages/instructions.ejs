        <h1> Welcome to Vibe Check! </h1>
        <p> The ultimate game to test if you can manage people. 
            Each character has a different difficulty level (1,2,3). 
            When a character is interacted with they can have a positive, negative, or neutral reaction to an action.
            There score will always increase by 5 (on a positive action) and decrease by 10 on a negative action.
            Your score will increase or decrease based on 5 multiplied by the character difficulty.
            Some actions cost money (you start with $50). 
            If you don't have enough money for any of the actions, you can ignore a character (although this will negatively affect your score).
            If you don't interact with a character for multiple rounds, their health will be affected.
            If you make a character happy enough they might start paying you back.
            But if they lose all their health, you lose the game.
